👋🏽 Hi, my name is Larissa

🎓 Grad with a Bachelor in Business Administration (2015) and a Master's of Science in Sociology (2020).

🌇 Brazilian Native, with a passion for traveling, exploring, food, and data storytelling. As a person, I always believed that knowledge
is power and the ability for data exploration brings infinite possibilities. I believe in the transformative power of data!! 

📚 *I started my career as a foreign trade sales support analyst. In 2020 I graduated from Virginia Commonwealth University with an MS in Sociology 
where I focused on statistical analysis in social research and my presentation skills.
I was also published in the International Migration scientific journal :)

💻 *As for my future, I hope to work as a data analyst in a team that leverages diversity and inclusion. I am a self-learner and currently, I am excited about exploring data beyond academic work and I am dedicated to learning SQL, Tableau, and R. I want to become an expert in data analysis and storytelling.
